# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores predictive factors influencing the successful landing of **SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket‚Äôs first stage**.  
By combining data from the **SpaceX API** and **Wikipedia web scraping**, the project applies **data wrangling, exploratory analysis, interactive dashboards, and machine learning models** to predict landing success.  

The **Decision Tree classifier** achieved the best performance with an accuracy of **88.9%**.  
Insights from this analysis can support **mission planning, risk assessment, and aerospace decision-making**.
